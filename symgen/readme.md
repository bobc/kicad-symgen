# Running symgen

Currently symgen contains hard-coded paths, so you will need to edit sym_gen.py before running it. In the current state, symgen is not recommended for non-experts.

## todos

* add parameter parsing so symgen can be run from command line
* put origin to center of component
* implement De Morgan variants
* handle doc fields
* handle all pin types
* IEEE style symbols
